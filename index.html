                <p class="text-small">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms,
                    profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of
                instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects,
                including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.
                In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Data and instructions
                were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks. In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control panel (plug board) added to
                his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs.
